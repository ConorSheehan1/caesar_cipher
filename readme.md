# Usage
You can open the program by either:

1. Opening a command prompt and typing "python caesar_cipher.py"
2. Opening the file in an IDE and running it.

The program ignores everything other than characters in the Latin alphabet [a-zA-Z].

It is possible to shift the text either direction in the alphabet because the program uses a circular list. For example shifting text back 1 letter (1) is equivalent to moving the text forward 25 letters (-25). This also makes it easier to reverse ciphers. If you already know how many letters a piece of text is shifted forward, put a minus in front of that number to unscramble the text.
